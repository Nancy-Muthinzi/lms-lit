Many people think that creating a web page involves really complicated code that requires considerable studying to understand. This is not necessarily the case. 

HyperText, is just a fancy word for text that links to something else. 
Markup Language means, is marked up with instructions written inside of angle brackets <>, known as tags. 

The actual language of HTML is the instructions that we wrap around the text to format it, instructions for many other things like images, links, videos and more.

What is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
    • HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    • HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
    • HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
    • HTML elements are represented by tags
    • HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
    • Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page
Example Explained
    • The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
    • The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    • The <head> element contains meta information about the document
    • The <title> element specifies a title for the document
    • The <body> element contains the visible page content
    • The <h1> element defines a large heading
    • The <p> element defines a paragraph
HTML Tags
HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:
<tagname>content goes here...</tagname>
    • HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>
    • The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
    • The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name
The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.
Indentation and Spacing
When writing HTML (or any other programming language), well-written code follows consistent indentation and spacing patterns. In some languages, indentation and spacing are required for the code to function properly. In HTML, inconsistent indentation and spacing will not impact the functionality of the web page but will cause your code to be difficult to read and understand.
Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them.
The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

Write HTML Using Notepad
Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.
However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC).
We believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
Follow the four steps below to create your first web page with Notepad.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My first webpage!</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
HTML pages are made up of two distinct parts - the head part, and the body part. The head contains things that won't appear on your page. Many of the elements that go in the head are advanced stuff to tell search engines and browsers about the page, so the only one you need to know for now is <title>.
